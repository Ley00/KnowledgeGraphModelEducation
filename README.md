<h2>
  Neural Networks for Graphs as Tools for reconnaissance of standards in educational data
</h2>
<h3>
  This project focuses on investigating and developing a graph neural network model to enhance pattern recognition in educational data. The primary goal is to early identify issues related to students at risk of dropping out and pinpoint factors contributing to academic failure. Ultimately, the model aims to assist educational institutions in anticipating and implementing preventive measures.
